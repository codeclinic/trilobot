# Raspberry Pi Trilobot
A short script to assign four functions to buttons A, B, X and Y on Trilobot. The bot can be controlled with an 8BitDo Lite gamepad. In parallel, the camera can be activated and streamed on a client using libcamera on the command line.

This code is based on the Pimoroni Trilobot library.
